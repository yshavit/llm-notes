"Why we focused on this": Modern LLMs (GPT, Claude, Llama) all use decoder-only
"If you want to learn more about X": pointers to other architectures and use cases

This would also be a good place to mention:

Why encoder-decoder exists (translation, summarization with separate input/output)
Why BERT exists (bidirectional context for classification/understanding tasks)
How your decoder-only model is optimized specifically for generation

It's like the bookend to your introduction—sets scope at the start, provides context at the end.
