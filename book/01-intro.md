# Introduction

## What is this book, and who's it for?

"You don't really understand something until you can explain it."

This book is my attempt to synthesize my understanding of how LLMs work. It's based on my reading of [_Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)_ by Sebastian Raschka][Raschka], as well as a lot of back and forth with AI chatbots to help me through the things I didn't understand.

I wrote this book for myself, because there's no better way to make sure you've learned something than to try to explain it. But it's my hope that others may find it useful as well.
