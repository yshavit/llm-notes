# Introduction

## What is this book, and who's it for?

"You don't really understand something until you can explain it."

This book is my attempt to synthesize my understanding of how LLMs work. It's based on my reading of [_Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)_ by Sebastian Raschka][Raschka].

The primary audience is me; but if you've found this and it helps you, all the better!

## Prerequisites

This book assumes high school math.

The most advanced math topic is vectors and matrices, and even for those, the book includes an overview of what you need to know. There is also a glancing blow of tensors, but again, I'll explain just what you need from those.

It's also helpful to have familiarity with derivatives, but you won't have to know the nitty-gritty.

## Organization

The driving principle behind this book's organization is that you should be able to read it front-to-back. This means:

- The book assumes you don't know anything relating to machine learning (ML) or LLMs.
- If you do know something, you can always skip past it; but you should never have to jump to an appendix and then back to where you were.

That said, I'll sometimes need to tease ahead to topics that I'll discuss in detail later. When I do, I'll try to give just enough context to make the current thing I'm explaining make sense. I'll provide cross-reference links where relevant, but you shouldn't need to click through to them.

(Human learning being the way it is, you may still need to refer back to a section you've already read; "front-to-back" doesn't mean you shouldn't ever need to do that. But the book isn't organized around you having to jump around.)
